    <h3 style="color: yellow;">So what is a Portfolio?</h3>
    <H4 style="color: lightblue;">Well, a Portfolio is a compilation of academic and professional materials that exemplifies your beliefs, skills, qualifications, education, training, and experiences. Pretty Cool! </H4>
    <H4 style="color: darkred;">Unfortunately, so far I have nothing to show off... and I am currently really inexperienced at this whole coding thing so that's fun I guess.</H4>
