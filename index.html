    <h1>Hello, GitHub! Welcome to the homepage.</h1>
    <h2>As we can see, this is an attempt at a Portfolio.</h2>

    <h3 style="color: yellow;">So what is a Portfolio?</h3>
    <H4 style="color: lightblue;">Well, a Portfolio is a compilation of academic and professional materials that exemplifies your beliefs, skills, qualifications, education, training, and experiences. Pretty Cool! </H4>
    <H5 style="color: darkred;">Unfortunately, so far I have nothing to show off... and I am currently really inexperienced at this whole coding thing so that's fun I guess.</H4>
     <img src="Knuckul.png" alt="image test 2 (failed... man, I really suck at this, huh?)">
    <H6 style="color: black;">Anyways, once I actually figure out how to use this thing, this is going to look WAY better than it already does. Or at least I hope it will.</H4>
    <H7 style="color: black;">But other than that, no big groundbreaking updates for now as I was sick for like an entire week, which is really unfortunate, but we'll see what I can do next time.</H4>
